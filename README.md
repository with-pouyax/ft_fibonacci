# ft_fibonacci

This repository features the `ft_fibonacci` function, a recursive implementation for calculating the Fibonacci sequence at a given index. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This function demonstrates a fundamental example of recursion in solving mathematical problems.

## Function Overview

The `ft_fibonacci` function computes the value of the Fibonacci sequence at a specific index. It showcases recursion, a powerful programming technique, by calling itself with decremented values until reaching the base cases.

### Function Prototype

```c
int ft_fibonacci(int index);
